**Legend says that whenever a whale farts in the Gulf of Bothnia, an earthquake happens in Oulu.**

**Fart gives - fart takes.**

## Controls
Move the whale with A and D, fart with space. When you destroy a building, you get punished by the god of sea and lose -5 points. However, if the building causes some humans to die when it's collapsing, you get +5 points per each human killed.
